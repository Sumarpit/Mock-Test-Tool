    ],

    "answer": 0,

    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: (a)</b><br><br><b>Option (a) is correct:</b> Rights are correlative with Duties. Every right has a corresponding duty; there can be no duty unless there is someone to whom it is due, and no right without a corresponding duty. Every right or duty involves a legal obligation binding two or more people. While the original Constitution did not explicitly list Fundamental Duties, Chapter IV-A (Article 51-A) was added in 1976 to emphasize citizens' obligations in exchange for the Fundamental Rights they enjoy."
