Better: 'The volatility in the market caused panic among investors regarding prices?' No, structure is fixed. Let's swap words to fit slots. <br>Slot A: Volatility (noun). <br>Slot B: Market (noun). <br>Slot C: Investors (noun). <br>Slot D: Prices/Panic? <br>Let's look at the logic: Volatility in the MARKET (C) caused PANIC (not bold) among INVESTORS (B). <br>Wait, the bold words are Volatility, Investors, Market, Prices. <br>Structure: The [Volatility/Prices] in the [Market] caused [Investors] to panic among [Prices/Volatility]. <br>Actually, 'Volatility in the market caused panic among investors' makes sense. But 'Panic' is not bold. <br>Let's check the options. <br>A-C swap: 'The market in the investors...' Incorrect. <br>Let's try swapping A with D: 'The prices in the...' <br>Let's look at the original: 'The [A] in the [B] caused [C] to panic among [D]'. <br>Correct logic: 'The <b>volatility (A)</b> in the <b>market (C)</b> caused <b>investors (B)</b> to panic about <b>prices (D)</b>.' (Assuming 'among' is a typo for 'about' or context implies 'panic among investors'). <br>Wait, the sentence says 'caused market to panic among prices'. <br>Maybe: 'The volatility in the <b>market (C)</b> caused <b>prices (D)</b> to panic among <b>investors (B)</b>?' No. <br>Correct Swap: Swap B and C? 'The volatility in the market (C) caused investors (B)...' Yes. <br>Is D correct? 'to panic among prices'. This phrasing is awkward. <br>Let's try A-D: 'The prices... panic among volatility'. No. <br>Let's assume the sentence structure is: 'The <b>volatility (A)</b> in the <b>prices (D)</b> caused <b>investors (B)</b> to panic in the <b>market (C)</b>.' <br>If we swap B with C? No. <br>Let's go with the most logical standard phrase: 'Volatility in the market'. Swap B and C. 'The volatility in the market caused investors to panic...'. This fits B-C swap. <br>Let's check option D: 'Only B-C'. <br>Result: 'The volatility in the market caused investors to panic among prices.' (Still awkward 'among prices', but 'Volatility in market' is a strong collocation). <br>Another possibility: A-D swap. 'The prices in the investors caused market to panic among volatility.'
