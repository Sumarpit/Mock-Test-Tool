While the passage mentions that effective corporate governance enhances access to external financing, it does not explicitly state that it is an important agenda of countries around the world.<br><br><b>Option b is correct:</b> The passage states that effective corporate governance structures encourage companies to provide accountability and control. It further explains that good corporate governance is important because it enhances access to external financing by firms. Investors are more likely to invest in companies that meet the standards of disclosure. Based on this, it can be inferred that good corporate governance improves the credibility of firms, making them more attractive for investment.<br><br><b>Option c is incorrect:</b> This option is not supported by the passage.

Much of the internet’s core infrastructure such as undersea cables, cloud servers, data centres, and digital platforms is owned or controlled by a small number of private corporations, many of which operate under the legal and regulatory frameworks of foreign countries. While this globally distributed structure has enabled efficiency, innovation, and cross-border connectivity, it also exposes states to vulnerabilities such as data breaches, cyber espionage, and strategic dependence on external legal regimes. In response, governments seek greater control over data flows and digital infrastructure in the name of national security and public interest. However, excessive state control risks fragmenting the internet, limiting innovation, and constraining individual freedoms. The central challenge lies in balancing digital sovereignty with the benefits of an open and interconnected global internet.",

      "Approve unrestricted clinical use to avoid delaying scientific progress.",
      "Prohibit all clinical applications until comprehensive international regulations are established.",
      "Allow controlled clinical trials under strict ethical oversight and make provision for a periodic review.",
      "To take suggestions from a group of international scientists who are specialist in the matter and then arrive at a decision."
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: (c)</b><br><br><b>Option (c) is correct:</b> The passage emphasizes the need to determine how innovation can proceed <i>responsibly</i> without eroding ethical safeguards or public trust, given that scientific capability advances faster than regulatory consensus. A controlled approach with strict ethical oversight and periodic review aligns with the passage's call for balancing innovation with responsibility.<br><b>Option (a) is incorrect:</b> The passage warns against proceeding without ethical safeguards.<br><b>Option (b) is incorrect:</b> The passage acknowledges the promise of these tools, so a complete prohibition is not suggested.<br><b>Option (d) is incorrect:</b> As a chairman, the advice must be tendered to the government based on the perspective of balancing ethics and innovation, rather than deferring the decision process entirely."

While early results are promising, regulatory frameworks are still evolving and long-term societal impacts remain uncertain.",
    "question": "Based on the passage regarding genetic editing technologies, the following assumptions have been made:<br>I. Governments must regulate genetic editing to ensure its safe and ethical use.<br>II. Developing humans with desired traits through genetic editing could disrupt the course of natural evolution.<br>Which of the assumptions given above is/are valid?",

    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: (a)</b><br><br><b>Assumption I is valid:</b> The passage explicitly states that 'scientific capability advances faster than regulatory consensus' and highlights the challenge of ensuring responsible innovation without eroding 'ethical safeguards or public trust.' This implies that government regulation is necessary for safe and ethical use.<br><b>Assumption II is invalid:</b> While the passage mentions ethical concerns about 'unintended consequences' and the 'limits of human intervention,' it does not explicitly assume that genetic editing will disrupt the course of natural evolution. This is a specific speculative consequence not directly supported by the text."

    "passage": "<b>Passage:</b> Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are gaining traction globally as a digital alternative to physical cash. While proponents argue that CBDCs can enhance financial inclusion, reduce transaction costs, and improve payment efficiency, critics raise concerns about data privacy and the potential for increased state surveillance. Furthermore, the introduction of CBDCs could disrupt the traditional banking sector by offering a direct claim on the central bank, potentially bypassing commercial banks. As countries experiment with pilot programs, the key challenge lies in designing CBDCs that balance innovation with privacy, stability, and public trust.",
    "question": "Based on the passage regarding Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), the following assumptions have been made:<br>I. As central banks across the world adopt CBDCs, the use of crypto assets would decline.<br>II. The rise of CBDCs may accelerate the growth of digital finance and strengthen the digital economy.<br>Which of the assumptions given above is/are correct?",
    "options": [
      "I only",
      "II only",
      "Both I and II",
      "Neither I nor II"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: (b)</b><br><br><b>Assumption I is invalid:</b> The passage states that CBDCs <i>could</i> prompt governments to impose stricter controls on cryptocurrencies, but it does not definitively state that the use of crypto assets <i>would</i> decline. The use of the definitive word 'would' makes this assumption incorrect based on the tentative language of the passage.<br><b>Assumption II is valid:</b> The passage explicitly states that CBDCs 'might legitimize and accelerate the acceptance of digital assets' and 'encourage regulators to adopt a balanced framework that promotes innovation,' thereby strengthening the digital economy."

While fragile, intangible cultural heritage is an important factor in maintaining cultural diversity in the face of growing globalization. An understanding of the intangible cultural heritage of different communities helps with intercultural dialogue, and encourages mutual respect for other ways of life. The importance of intangible cultural heritage is not the cultural manifestation itself but rather the wealth of knowledge and skills that is transmitted through it from one generation to the next.",

      "II only",

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: (b)</b><br><br><b>Assumption I is invalid:</b> The passage states that intangible cultural heritage is an 'important factor in maintaining cultural diversity in the face of growing globalization,' but it does not explicitly claim that globalization is currently <i>eroding</i> diverse cultural heritage (homogenization). It focuses on the protective role of heritage rather than the negative impact of globalization.<br><b>Assumption II is valid:</b> The passage describes intangible cultural heritage as comprising 'traditions or living expressions inherited from our ancestors' and notes its role in maintaining diversity and fostering identity. Thus, preserving it is essential to safeguarding these living traditions."

For millions of youth, the pursuit of these jobs has become a singular obsession, a marathon where the finish line keeps receding. Years are spent in cramped rooms, poring over books, fuelled by hope and the pressure of parental expectations. This protracted wait, often spanning the most productive decade of life, extracts a heavy toll—psychological distress, delayed adulthood, and a deep sense of stagnation. As the years slip by, the initial zeal turns into anxiety, and the dream of service morphs into a desperate need for security. The system, overwhelmed by numbers, measures merit in marks and endless delays, inadvertently creating a generation in waiting—waiting for exams, waiting for results, waiting for appointments. In this waiting, something vital is lost—not just time, but potential. Not fields, not workshops, not new ideas, not creativity, but a quiet corrosion of trust in the promise that hard work leads to a secure future.",

    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: (a)</b><br><br><b>Option (a) is correct:</b> The passage vividly describes the psychological strain ('heart learns the grammar of patience and panic', 'dreams shrink') and the broader loss to the nation ('Not fields, not workshops...').
