Financial Profit (Start) -> Add -> Cost Profit. BUT if the question implies adjusting Financial Profit to match actuals? Usually: Start Financial Profit -> Deduct expenses not charged. Here: Cost profit has LESS expense charged. Financial has MORE. So Financial Profit is LOWER. To get to Cost Profit (Higher), we ADD. <br>Wait, let's re-verify standard rule: Start Financial Profit. Under-absorbed in cost means expenses in cost < expenses in financial. Thus Profit in Cost > Profit in Financial. To go FROM Financial TO Cost, we must ADD the difference. <br><b>Correction:</b> If starting with Cost Profit to find Financial Profit, we Deduct. The question asks starting with Financial Profit.
