      "IS curve shifts to the left",
      "IS curve shifts to the right",
      "LM curve shifts to the right",
      "LM curve shifts to the left"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: IS curve shifts to the right</b><br><br>The IS curve represents the goods market. An increase in autonomous spending (like Government Expenditure) increases aggregate demand at every interest rate, shifting the IS curve to the right. This typically raises both output (Y) and interest rates (i).",

      "Multiplier Effect",
      "Pigou Effect"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: Crowding Out</b><br><br>When the government borrows to fund spending (shifting IS right), demand for loanable funds rises, pushing up interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing expensive for private firms, reducing private investment (I).",

      "Horizontal",
      "Downward sloping"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: Horizontal</b><br><br>In a Liquidity Trap, interest rates are so low that people prefer to hold cash rather than bonds. The demand for money becomes infinitely elastic, making the LM curve horizontal. Monetary policy (shifting LM) becomes ineffective here.",

      "Upward sloping"

    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: Vertical at the Natural Rate of Unemployment</b><br><br>In the long run, inflation expectations adjust fully. Unemployment returns to its 'Natural Rate' (NAIRU), regardless of the inflation rate. There is no long-run trade-off.",

      "Technological advancement",
      "Decrease in Inflation Expectations"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: Negative Supply Shock</b><br><br>A supply shock (like rising oil prices) raises costs for firms, causing them to raise prices (inflation) and cut output/employment (unemployment) simultaneously. This shifts the SRPC to the right.",

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: Shifts to the Right</b><br><br>Buying bonds injects liquidity into the system, increasing the Money Supply (Ms). An increase in Ms lowers the interest rate for any given level of income, shifting the LM curve to the right.",

    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: Potential Output (Full Employment)</b><br><br>The LRAS is vertical because, in the long run, an economy's production depends on capital, labor, and technology, not on the price level.",

    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: A decrease in tax revenue</b><br><br>The Laffer Curve illustrates that excessively high tax rates disincentivize work and investment, shrinking the tax base. Thus, higher rates can eventually reduce total revenue collected.",

    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: Higher Output, Indeterminate Interest Rate</b><br><br>Expansionary Fiscal Policy (G up) shifts IS right (increasing Y and i). Expansionary Monetary Policy (Ms up) shifts LM right (increasing Y but lowering i). Therefore, Output (Y) definitely rises, but the effect on Interest Rate (i) depends on the magnitude of the shifts.",

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "<b>Correct Answer: Fall below the Natural Rate</b><br><br>If actual inflation > expected, real wages fall, encouraging firms to hire more labor. This pushes unemployment below the natural rate temporarily, moving the economy up along the SRPC.",
